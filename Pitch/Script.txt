Hello My name is Tiffany

and my name is Greg and we would like to talk to you about our smart living project to help develop indepence for the aged.

<background on need> https://www.wearable-technologies.com/2015/05/wearables-for-elderly/

to solve this problem we would like to create an IOT heart rate monitor designed to notify emergency contacts or emergency services when the users heart rate becomes irregular

<Sense-Think-Act breakdown>

the project will use a HR sensor to collect heart beat data

it will use a collection of this heart rate data to calculate the bpm of the user

and if the heart rate is outside of normal levels it will alert
